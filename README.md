This project was created in the 2024 Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program. It advocates for the end of period poverty by informing users about the issue and educating them on the different ways they can help fight against this issue. Three key features of this website include an interactive button that generates facts whenever it is pressed, an area that generates messages based on user inputs, and a responsive page design where elements of the website change to fit the screen size. This project was coded using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
